This market growth is primarily driven by the increasing demand for infection control and hygiene standards in healthcare facilities. As hospitals aim to maintain stringent cleanliness protocols, the need for professional linen and laundry services continues to rise. Furthermore, the expansion of healthcare infrastructure, particularly in emerging markets, contributes to the overall demand for outsourced linen management solutions. The rising awareness of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) has also led to more rigorous hygiene practices, further propelling market growth.AI and automation are significantly transforming the hospital linen and laundry services sector. Automation technologies, such as robotic laundry sorting, AI-powered quality control, and predictive maintenance systems, have enhanced operational efficiency and reduced human error. AI algorithms help optimize laundry cycles by analyzing data on fabric types and contamination levels, ensuring effective cleaning while reducing water and energy consumption.
