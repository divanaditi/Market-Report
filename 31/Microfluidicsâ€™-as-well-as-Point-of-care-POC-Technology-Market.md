This rapid growth is driven by increasing demand for high-throughput screening and lab-on-a-chip devices across various applications including diagnostics, drug development, and environmental monitoring. In parallel, the point-of-care (POC) technology market was valued at about $25.6 billion in 2022, with a robust CAGR of 14.7% expected over the same period. This expansion reflects the growing emphasis on decentralized healthcare, which enhances patient outcomes through real-time diagnostics and treatment solutions at the bedside or remote locations.<-p><p>The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and automation is profoundly transforming both markets. AI algorithms are optimizing data analysis and enhancing diagnostic accuracy in microfluidics by enabling sophisticated pattern recognition and predictive analytics. Automation is streamlining workflows, reducing manual errors, and increasing throughput in POC systems, thereby facilitating faster and more reliable testing processes. The synergy between AI and automation is thus expected to drive further growth and innovation in these sectors, making advanced technologies more accessible and efficient in medical and research applications.<-p>t<-p><p id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of Microfluidicsâ€™ as well as Point-of-care (POC) Technology Market Report @ <a href="https:--www.verifiedmarketreports.com-download-sample-?rid=422522&utm_source=Github-R&utm_medium=309" target="_blank">https:--www.verifiedmarketreports.com-download-sample-?rid=422522&utm_source=Github-R&utm_medium=309<-a><-strong><-p><p>The importance of&nbsp;Microfluidicsâ€™ as well as Point-of-care (POC) Technology Market research reports lies in their ability to aid strategic planning, helping businesses develop effective strategies by understanding market trends and dynamics.
